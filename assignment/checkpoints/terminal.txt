# 7 - Run 'git --version' in your terminal. What is the output?
        if you have git installed, it will tell you: git version 2.30.1 (or whatever you have installed)
# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?
        To get the status of the directory you're working in, as well as the staging area, where your files live before committing. 
        This means that you get to see things like: how many commits ahead of the 
        main branch you are; it allows you to see what files have been staged for commits, prior to committing them to the work history; This
        in turn also allows you to unstage any files that you have staged. 
# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?
        this step comes beore committing, where you stage the files that you are currently working on. Staging mean that you are telling GitHub
        the particular files that you will be updating in the next commit. 
# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?
        git push origin main / though it sounded like there might be some scenarios where the 'main' tag is not used.
