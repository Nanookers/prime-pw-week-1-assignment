# 5 - What output would you expect when you run the command 'ls' in an empty folder? What about a folder containing files?
        an empty folder yields no results. a folder w/ files produces a list of the available files in the folder. 
# 6 - What is a quick way to create a new file?
        In a new folder, type 'touch' index.html or style.css or helloWorld.js -- then to open them from terminal type code .   
# 7 - Run 'git --version' in your terminal. What is the output?
        if you have git installed, it will tell you: git version 2.30.1 (or whatever you have installed)
# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?
        To get the status of the staged files. This means that you get to see things like: how many commits ahead of the 
        main branch you are; it allows you to see what files have been staged for commits, prior to committing them to the work history
# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?
        It allows you to update and save the files without committing any changes to them. 
# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?
        git push origin main / though it sounded like there might be some scenarios where the 'main' tag is not used.
